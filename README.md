# MUSE
Code and data for the paper "MUSE: Mining Unexpected Solutions Engine"
paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05072

This repository contains:
1. Graph files - the files for a Functional Concept Graph constructed from 500k patents extracted from the US patent dataset. Released for future work.
2. Grpah code - code and data used for creating the FCG.
3. Experiment code - code used for the user-study described in the paper.


## Graph Files



## Graph_code
The graph creation process is divided into a few separate steps.
  1. Getting graph nodes with clustering (Clustering.py). An example for running this step is given in clustering_batch.sh/ 
  2.
